# Portable Trophies Specifications

A repository for the Portable Trophies specifications. Forked from OpenBadges 1.1, this is a work in progress aiming to make a suitable 1.0 spec soon. Main impetous is making them correctly portable, as OpenBadges are not standalone, have mixed modes which spreads the spec out, and lack extendable localisation.

* [Assertion](/Assertion.md): Main specification for the trophy data. If you want to understand how trophies are made and verified, this is the place to look.

* [Baking](/Trophy-Baking.md): Trophy “baking” is the process of embedding a trophy assertion into an image (a PNG or an SVG) so that where ever that image goes, the assertion data goes with it and the trophy can be independently verified.
